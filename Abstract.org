Software has become an essential component in basically every part of
the research cycle. Still, there are no comprehensive guidelines how
core principles of good scientific practice like transparency and
reproducibility can and should be applied to research
software. Further open question are how to guarantee high quality of
such software, how current and future researcher need to be trained
and incentivized to generate sustainable software. To ensure to
frictionless reuse and long term availability of software dedicated
infrastructure for research software needs to be established and
knowledge about open/libre software licenses disseminated. These and
numerous other issues were so far only partially and inconsistently
addressed by Germany universities and funding/research institutions.

The Alliance of Science Organisations which consists of all large
German research organisations and the universities has launched the
ad-hoc working group "Research Software" as part of the initiative
"Digital Information" to find solutions for these issues. This working
group aims to address the general questions regarding research
software and to compile a canon of guideline and recommendations for
the German and international research community. 

In this talk those questions and their potential solutions will be
presented and discussed.
